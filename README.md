## My Works 
I use this repository as a way to represent my portfolio in software development career path. Following here are the picked apps/web/games/software that I have created so far. Still, there are several more but they do not worth officially metioning, but if you are interested, most of them, which are public, can be located in my github profile.

By the way, the list you are about to see is rougly sorted by chronological order.
